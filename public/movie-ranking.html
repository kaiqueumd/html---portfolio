<h3>Back to the Future</h3>

<p><b>Director:</b> Robert Zemeckis</p>
<p><b>Cast:</b> Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover</p>
<p><b>Famous quote:</b> “If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour… you’re gonna see some serious shit.” — Dr. Emmett Brown</p>

<p>Fox was filming Family Ties when Zemeckis tapped the 24-year-old television star to play unwitting time traveler Marty McFly. (He was replacing Eric Stoltz, who had shot a few scenes but proved the wrong fit.) Fox worked nights and weekends, which explains why he looks so exasperated in most of the film.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p><b>Director:</b> Frank Darabont</p>
<p><b>Cast:</b> Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman</p>
<p><b>Famous quote:</b> "Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” – Andy Dufresne </p>

<p>Of all the adaptations of Stephen King stories — and they are legion because he is the most-adapted living writer — this is only one of two (along with The Shining) to make the list.
All that Shawshank love apparently came after the film’s unexceptional theatrical release, when it began popping up on cable TV nearly as regularly as Geico commercials. In 2013, 151 hours of basic cable time was devoted to airing the 142-minute movie. That’s about six days of watching Robbins try to escape from prison.</p>
<h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>

<p><b>Director:</b> Victor Fleming</p>
<p><b>Cast:</b> Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover</p>
<p><b>Famous quote:</b> “Lions, and tigers, and bears! Oh, my!” — Dorothy</p>

<p>“If I was on a desert island, I’d bring The Wizard of Oz with me,” says Elizabeth Daley, dean of the USC School of Cinematic Arts. “It always makes me feel alive. I could watch it over and over.” And people have, generation after generation. In fact, it’s the most-watched film of all time, according to the Library of Congress, thanks to regular showings on broadcast television since the mid-1950s (and on cable since the ‘90s). That’s not including sequels and prequels, which Hollywood keeps releasing each decade like swarms of flying monkeys. The most recent, Oz the Great and Powerful, starring James Franco as a hunky young wizard, grossed more than $230 million domestically. That yellow brick road clearly is made of gol</p>
